<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Definition of Statistics</h2>
<p><strong>Statistics</strong> is frequently defined as a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation and organization of data. One of the key aspects of statistics is that it formalizes methods to operate in an uncertain world. It gives us a set of tools to get clear quantitative assessments of situations, and to make estimates and predictions with the corresponding estimates of uncertainty.</p>
<p>For example, the “situation” is to determine if milk productivity in terms of kg/ha of farm is increasing or decreasing in California. A sample of farms is selected and milk production and farm area are measured over two years. Based on the measurements, an estimate of the difference between years is calculated, as well as an interval that represents the uncertainty of the estimate.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-statistics" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Learning Statistics</h2>
<p>Learning statistics can be challenging but also fun. The math involved in introductory statistics is very basic and for the most part involves only addition and multiplication. You can use statistics to make better decisions about your life. You should use statistical knowledge to properly interpret pseudo information presented in advertisements and the media.</p>
<p>Many statistical concepts and methods have intuitive counterparts. Humans have intuitions and subconscious methods to deal with uncertainty which evolved because they have adaptive value. For example,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/news/humans-have-innate-grasp-of-probability-1.16271" target="_blank">Innate concept of probability</a></p>
<p>Although humans do have an innate ability to assess contingencies and likelihood of certain events, our intuitive ability is far from perfect. In fact, it has been shown that humans tend to be particularly bad at estimating probabilities in certain situations. Kahneman and Tversky refer to the probabilities people guess without using calculations and the theory of probability as “subjective” probability.</p>
<p>*** Add basic concepts from David Kahneman Amos Tversky 1972 ***</p>
<p>Statistical methods allow us to remove some of the biases introduced by human intuition. Many of the errors Kahneman and Tversky’s subjects made would have been prevented if those subjects used statistical calculations instead of their intuition.For example, K&amp;T posed the following question to high school students: All families of six children in a city were surveyed. In 72 families the exact order of births of boys and girls was GBGBBG. What is your estimate of the number of families surveyed in which the exact order of births was BGBBBB? What do you think? The median (add cross reference to definition of median in Ch04) estimate that students gave was 30. If the probability of G and B are the same, then both sequences have equal probability.</p>
<p>In another series of experiments, K&amp;T asked students to estimate sampling distributions for various processes, for example, the number of boys and girls born each day. They concluded that:</p>
<p>“The notion that sampling variance decreases in proportion to sample size is apparently not part of man’s repertoire of intuitions.”</p>
<p>This is very interesting and challenging, because the fact that variance of sample averages decreases with sample size is the most important concept for this course!</p>
<p>Why are we bringing these things up?? The point is that when you need to deal with uncertainty, you cannot trust your intuition. If you need to get it right, use statistics and do the calculations. It is important for you to know that it is not safe to rely on raw intuition to solve many problems that involve estimation of probabilities and statistical distributions. Although at some point, we believe that many statistical and probability concepts can become almost intuitive with practice, the message is clear: using untrained intuition to deal with uncertainty leads to error.</p>

<p>Probability, estimation, inference Fixed part and random part Models</p>
<p>Humans and animals go about our lives acting and making decision with uncertainty. Although the world is for the most part deterministic, we are not able to know it in sufficient detail to have certainty about events that have not yet happened or that we cannot observe. Even when we can observe events, the picture of reality that is created in our brains differs from reality because our senses are imperfect. Evolutionary psychology has documented multiple cases and offers theories to understand why it is not possible and even not good to know everything. The brain and the senses are products of evolution and reflect the conditions and constraints within which they evolved (reference).</p>
</div>
<div id="statistics-defined" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Statistics Defined</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that the word “statistics” can have several meanings, even within the filed of statistics. We can say that <em>statistics</em> is the science of data collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation of results. As a science, statistics uses mathematical models and mathematics extensively. However, we also use the term <em>statistic</em> to refer to the result of applying a function to a set of sample data. For example. the average of a set of numbers is a statistic. The name of the science ends in “s” but it is singular (“Statistics is a science.”) whereas in reference to calculations based on samples the term can be plural or singular. For example, we say the sample average is one <em>statistic</em> of the various <em>statistics</em> that can be calculated from a sample.</p>
</div>
<div id="book-organization-and-overview" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Book Organization and Overview</h2>
<p>The big picture is that in order to deal with uncertainty, uncertainty has to be quantified. This is done with the use of probabilities (chapter @ref(ch.prob)).</p>
<p>Then we have to assign probabilities to events of interest, like the failure of an engine, or the yield of a field being sufficient to cover the costs of cropping. This step requires that we create model distributions for different types of random experiments, such as running an engine for 5,000 hours or planting a field.</p>
<p>Distribution models will frequently involve parameters such as the mean and variance that are unknown, which requires that we obtain sample data and analyze it to estimate parameters. Estimated parameters add a second layer of uncertainty. These two layers of uncertaint are illustrated with an example. imagine that you draw a marble radomly from an urn that has 9 white and 1 orange marble. We are uncertain about the color of the marble drawn, but we are certain that the proability of white is 9/10. Now, suppose that I add black and white marbles to the urn, but you do not know how many of each I added. When you draw another marble at random you will be uncertain about the color of the marble AND about the probability of getting a white one. You could take a sample of marbles with replacement (easier to calculate), meaning that you put each marble back after you observe it, and record the colors. Say that in a sample of 20 marbles you get 10 white ones. Now you can estimate the probability of white as 10/20 = 0.5, but you would not be sure that this is the true proportion of marbles. You used a sample of 20 marbles to <strong>estimate</strong> the proportions. But youwould probably get different results in other samples. THe quesiton is, how certain are you that the proportion is 0.5? The answer to this question requires that we determine how much the proportion in a sample varies from sample to sample. Therefore, in this third step we need to use methods to determine the sampling distribution of the estimated parameters.</p>
<p>Finally, we will frequently be interested in comparing parameters from potentially different distributions. We could have a second urn with marbles and be interested in determining if the probability of getting a white marble from the first is greater or less than from the second. Or we could be interested in determining if the mean productivity of a new crop variety is greater than the old one. These comparisons are reduced to calculating the value and distribution of linear combinations of estimated parameters. Usually, the distribution is normal, so the problem reduces to estimating the variance of a linear combination of estimated parameters. Analysis of variance is key to achieve this.</p>
<p>This book has 14 chapters dealing with introductory statistical methods and concepts. The first section comprises chapters 1-3 provide essential but minimal tools necessary to be able to read and understand the rest of the book.</p>
<p>This first chapter introduces statistics and the rest of the book. It gives a general introduction to the need for formal methods that yield repeatable quantitative results to deal with uncertainty in an optimal manner. Chapter 2 is an introduction to the tool that we use for doing statistics: R and RStudio. R is the program that actually does all the computations; essentially, it is a programming language for statistics. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that handles the creation and debugging of code, as well as the input and output. Chapter 2 is necessary because this book is written using RStudio and code for R. There are examples, exercises and explanations that use R in the rest of the chapters. Chapter 3 presents the required math skills and symbols that are used in the rest of the book.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.9</span> Use and Misuse of Statistics</h2>
<p>Theme: There are compelling arguments indicating that statistics has been misunderstood and misused. There is a dominating culture of users of statistics who do not understand the exact original meaning of the methods and who misuse them. This has resulted in a culture where statistics is considered obscure and where the two main approaches (Bayesian and frequentist) are pitted against each other.</p>
<p>Explain the misunderstanding and misuse of P</p>
<p><a href "https://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700" target="_blank">Not understanding and misusing p-value</a></p>
<p>End section with a positive note that by truly understanding we will see that statistical methods become</p>
<p>In dealing with problems or questions we will use the following approach:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify and define the problem or question.</li>
<li>Define what will be accepted as a useful solution.</li>
<li>Determine quantities that need to be estimated for solution.</li>
<li>Find and use a method to estimate such quantities.</li>
<li>State solution.</li>
<li>Implement solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Math and calculations will be necessary, particularly in step 4. Frequently, in order to get to the solution the question has to be cast in the framework of an already existing mathematical procedure that is not immediately intuitive. A specific case if the use of analysis of variance to determine if means are different. The question is: “are means different?”&quot; but the method compares variances instead of means! The approach works because there is an underlying theory that states that if means are different, then variances will also differ by an amount related to the difference among means. We do not need to know the exact details of the calculations in order to understand the process to an acceptable degree.</p>
<p>In many real applications of advanced statistics, step 4 involves massive computations with complicated software that can only be fully understood from a computational math science approach. We do not need to study computational math. We just need to understand the concepts behind the computation. It is sufficient to know that the computation yields a good approximation to the optimal estimate for the unknown quantity, where “optimal” means that the sum of squared deviations are minimized).</p>
<p>Some computations are rather simple and we may look into those to get a better concept of what computation does.</p>

<p>Goal: Do many random experiments and estimations. Identify the elements involved in making estimates and sources of variation.</p>
<p>This exercise is actually a game. The team that guesses the secret target most accurately wins the game. Students will form two teams. Each team will designate a pitcher or thrower. Pitchers will proceed to the front game area and get the projectiles (these projectiles can be darts or small chalk or sand bags). A horizontal line with marks and labels every 2 inches is drawn for each pitcher on the board. The referee gives each pitcher a different position as their target. Those numbers remain unknown to everyone else. Each pitcher throws the projectile at the designated position in the line three times, and the referee marks each hit on the horizontal line. Vertical positions are ignored. Each team collectively guesses the target point for their pitcher. Guesses are plotted against number of pitches on the board. Five to 6 rounds of throws and guesses are conducted. The team that is closest to their pitcher’s true target wins. After the award ceremony, the following questions are asked for discussion:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What factors determined the winner?</li>
<li>Was one of the pitchers better? In what way?</li>
<li>Which values varied between throws and which ones were constant?</li>
<li>What would a team’s guess if their pitcher did a large number of throws?</li>
<li>What is the frequency of different distances from the true target?</li>
<li>Why do distances from the target vary among throws? What does random mean?</li>
