# Treatment Structures and Comparisons {#ch.trtstr}

## Learning Objectives for Chapter
Jen's:
1. Identify the treatment in a factorial experiment
2. State the null and alternative hypotheses of a factorial experiment.
3. Define "main effect" and "interaction"
4.  Given a graph of factorial experiment results, determine if there are main effects and/or interaction effects. 
5. Calculate PLSD confidence intervals for a pairwise comparison of means and determine if two means are significantly different based on the CIs. 


Design factorial treatment combinations to answer a research question.
Create linear combinations of means that address practical real-world questions.
Transform real-world question into a null hypothesis about means.
Test hypotheses involving more than one and more than 2 means.
Interpret result of ANOVA with factorial treatments.
Interpret graph of a factorial experiment, including description of L, Q and C trends.
Given a set of treatments, formulate and tests useful contrasts.
Determine if a linear combination of means is a contrast.
Estimate the variance of a linear combination of means.
Make confidence intervals for linear combination of estimated means.
