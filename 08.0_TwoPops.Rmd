1. Describe the four cases for comparing two populations means and determine when each one applies for a problem.
1. Perform an F-test of homogeneity of variance using samples from two populations.
1. After performing a two sample t test, sketch the t distribution, with the following parts labeled: 
  - the critical t value
  - the test statistic
  - the p value area under the curve.
  - the alpha level area under the curve. 
  - where the CI bounds would lie on the X axis (approximately)
1. Interpret the results of a t-test in terms of the original scientific question. 

We have learned in the previous chapters how to determine if a sample is significantly different from the population it belongs to.  However, researchers may want to know if two populations are significantly different from each other.  In research experiments, populations are considered distinct when there are unique treatments that are applied to them.  For example, one could conduct an experiment comparing a fertilized field to an unfertilized field to determine a difference in yield, or an experiment comparing a high-protein diet to a high-carbohydrate diet to determine a difference in milk quality among cows.   These experiments are conducted by taking samples from each of the populations and using the differences between the two samples to make inferences about the differences between the two treatment populations.  

There are two different methods of sampling to compare treatment means: independent samples or paired (dependent) samples.  Samples are considered independent when there is no relationship between the observations in one treatment and the observations in the other treatment.  For example, pigs are randomly assigned to two different diets to collectively measure the difference in body weight.  Samples are considered paired or dependent when there is a relationship between the observations in one treatment and the observations in the other treatment.  For example, two pigs from the same pen are assigned to different diets to measure the difference in body weight among all the paired pigs from the same pen. 

##Hypothesis Testing
When testing if there is a significant difference between two populations and/or two treatments, our null  hypothesis and alternative hypothesis can be stated, respectively, as 

$H_0 : \mu_1 = \mu_2$         or       $\mu_{\bar{d}} = 0$
$H_1 : \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$      or       $\mu_{\bar{d}} \neq 0$

In previous chapters, we used the t-stastic for hypothesis testing within a single population.  The t-statistic can also be used for hypothesis testing between two populations by treating it as a single population consisting of the differences between the two treatments.  

To perform a hypothesis test for two populations, the difference between the two samples averages ($\bar{d}$), the mean of the difference ($\mu_{\bar{d}}$), and the standard error of the difference ($S_{\bar{d}}$) are needed to calculate the t-statistic.  

$\bar{d} = \bar{Y}_1 - \bar{Y}_2$

$\mu_{\bar{d}} = ( \mu_1 - \mu_2 )$

$t = \frac{ (\bar{d} - \mu_{\bar{d}})} {S_{\bar{d}}}$

These standard error of the difference will be calculated differently depending on (1) if the samples are independent or paired, (2) if the population variances are equal or unequal and (3) if the sample sizes are equal or unequal.  This presents four unique cases to calculate the standard error of the difference which is needed to calculate the t-statistic. 

#Case 1      Independent samples with unequal population variances

When the population variances are unequal or it is unknown, we calculate the standard error of the differences using the known information about the sample variances and sample sizes

$S_{\bar{d}} = ( \frac {{S_1}^2}{r_1} + \frac {{S_2}^2}{r_2} )^{1/2}$ 

#Case 2      Independent samples with equal population variances but unequal sample sizes

When the two population variances are equal, then the two sample variances are estimates of the same population variance.  To calculate a better estimate of this value, we can average the two sample variances to calculate the pooled sample variance $( S^2 )$.

$S^2 = \frac {({{S_1}^2})({r_1 - 1}) + ({{S_2}^2})({r_2 - 1})} {(r_1 + r_2 - 2)}$      with     $df = r_1 + r_2 -2$

When the sample variances are pooled, the standard error of the differences can be calculated as

$S_{\bar{d}} = [({S}^2)({1 / r_1} + {1 / r_2})]^{1/2}$ 


#Case 3      Independent samples with equal population variances and equal sample sizes

When the two population variances are equal and the two sample sizes are equal, the pooled variance and the standard error of the difference can be calculated as

$S^2 = \frac {{{S_1}^2} + {{S_2}^2}} {2}$       with     $df = 2(r-1)$

$S_{\bar{d}} = (\frac {{2S}^2}{r} )^{1/2}$ 

#Case 4      Paired samples

When observations come from one common unit (adjacent plots in the same field, pigs from the same pen) and are assigned to different treatments, they are considered paired samples.  The difference between paired averages, the variance of the difference, the standard error of the difference, and the t-statistic are calculated 

$\bar{d} = \frac{\sum{d_i}}{r}$

$S_d^2 = \frac{\sum(d_i -\bar{d})^2}{r -1}$

$S_\bar{d} = (\frac{S_d^2}{r})^{1/2}$

### Part 1 [25 points]

Mass per mature seed (mg) of an invasive grass (medusahead, *Taeniatherum caput-medusae*) was measured when plants were grown in several randomly selected plots of perennial or annual grasses typical of the California Grasslands. The data are included in the R block below. 'A' stands for annual and 'P' for perennial.

Does the variance of seed mass differ between treatments (perennial vs. annual)? Perform a test of hypothesis at the 5% level (Î±=.05) using the F-statistic. Look up the critical F value in Table A.7 and by using the qf(p = 0.05, df1 = , df2 = ) function.

Complete the calculations "by hand", using only basic R functions like var(). Then, use the var.test () R function to test for difference of variances.

### Part 3 [30 points]

Twelve plants were used in an experiment to study the effectiveness of using praying mantises to control aphid populations. Aphid density was measured before and after the addition of a mantis to the plant. Perform a test to determine if the mantis reduces aphid density. (Note that these are fictitious data and that the experimental design is simplified for teaching purposes. A real experiment should include a series of control plants to make sure that the potential change in aphid density is not due to other uncontrolled causes besides the addition of the mantis).


```{r}

aphids <- read.csv("Aphids.txt", header = TRUE)

before <- aphids$before

after <- aphids$after

### Part 4: Paired or independent? [15 points]

For the following situations please determine if you should be conducting an independent or a paired t-test. Make sure to justify your answers!  In some of these situations multiple pieces of information are being collected so please indicate what groups/variables are being compared.

#### A. A researcher is interested in whether the presence of natural enemies significantly reduces herbivory from the invasive pest soybean aphid (Aphis glycines). She randomly chooses 36 individual soybean plants in 4 fields to measure. As a proxy for herbivory, she counts the number of soybean aphids on each plant. She then encloses half of the plants with a mesh exclusion cage, through which aphids can pass but large predatory insects cannot. After two weeks, she counts aphids on all 36 plants again, and determines the net change in aphid abundance under each treatment.

#### B. A master gardener wants to know whether his decision to use organic compost instead of synthetic fertilizer is going to change the yield of his broccoli. To test this, he applies a consistent amount of fertilizer or compost to the soil in each of six plots in a random design (3 receive compost, 3 receive fertilizer). He then plants the same variety of broccoli in all plots and measures the average yield (grams of broccoli head per plant) at harvest for each treatment.
