# Two Populations Means {#ch.2pops}

## Learning Objectives for Chapter

1. Compare two population means based on two samples.
1. State the null and alternative hypothesis for a two sample t-test.  
1. Determine if samples are paired or unpaired ("independent") when comparing two means.
1. Describe the three cases for comparing two populations means and determine when each one applies for a problem.
1. Perform an F-test of homogeneity of variance using samples from two populations.
1. After performing a two sample t test, sketch the t distribution, with the following parts labeled: 
  - the critical t value
  - the test statistic
  - the p value area under the curve.
  - the alpha level area under the curve. 
  - where the CI bounds would lie on the X axis (approximately)
1. Interpret the results of a t-test in terms of the original scientific question.
