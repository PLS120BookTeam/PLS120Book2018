This is a project to create an interactive online book with pdf counterpart for the course PLS120 Applied Statistics in Agricultural Science.

There should be a license file in the repository. For now, we intend to keep the copyright of all materials in the book, so have that in mind if you collaborate or clone the project. We will probably change this to some license that allows open use later.
